# Five_RGB

An RGB project where I used 5 RGB's with 1 button in order to make them all light the same color, but then, since the selected LED always changes, when the button is pressed, selected LED changes color accordingly, then, since the new color is selected, every other LED that comes after the selected one will also change to that color.
